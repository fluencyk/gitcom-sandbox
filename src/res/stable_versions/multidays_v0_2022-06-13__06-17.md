# multidays_v0 (2022-06-13 → 2022-06-17)

## Status
- Stable
- Executed successfully across 5 consecutive days
- No rest-day modeling

## Purpose
This version serves as the first validated multidays execution
with anti-time-paradox protection.

## Module Overview
- multidays_commit_test.py
- time_engine.py (legacy, renamed later to time_set.py)
- anti_timedox.py
- identity.py
- file_add / file_delete
- git_push.py

## Execution Flow (High-Level)
1. Initialize multidays execution
2. Iterate through date sequence
3. Validate timestamp monotonicity
4. Apply minimal file operations
5. Commit once per day
6. Push changes

## Verified Properties
- Anti time paradox enforced
- Commit timestamps accepted by GitHub
- Author identity consistent
- No empty commit days

## Known Limitations
- No rest-day modeling
- No intensity variation
- No weekend semantics

## Notes
This version is intentionally frozen and should not be modified.
